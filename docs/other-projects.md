### Other Projects
Wearable Health Data Aggregator: Developed a backend service to collect and unify time-series
health data from wearable devices (e.g. heart rate, steps, sleep metrics) via third-party APIs.
Emphasized robust data ingestion and storage to enable continuous monitoring of health metrics
and easy retrieval of trends .
User Behavior Logging Service: Implemented a microservice that captures application user events
with precise timestamps, enabling analysis of usage patterns and trends . The system efficiently
aggregates high-volume logs to produce real-time metrics and actionable user engagement
insights.
Sleep Data Analytics Dashboard: Built an analytics pipeline using Python and Flask to transform
raw sleep logs into visual insights. Data is stored in a SQL database and presented with Chart.js for
interactive time-series visualizations , allowing users to track sleep quality trends and analyze
